            I just wanna stay in the sun where I find<br>
            I know it's hard sometimes<br>
            Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind<br>
            I know it's hard sometimes<br>
            Yeah, I think about the end just way too much<br>
            But it's fun to fantasize<br>
            On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was<br>
            But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)<br>
            <br>
            Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br>
            So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br>
            So I'm takin' my time on my ride<br>
            Takin' my time on my ride<br>
            <br>
            "I'd die for you," that's easy to say<br>
            We have a list of people that we would take<br>
            A bullet for them, a bullet for you<br>
            A bullet for everybody in this room<br>
            But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through<br>
            See many bullets comin' through<br>
            Metaphorically, I'm the man<br>
            But literally, I don't know what I'd do<br>
            "I'd live for you," an' that's hard to do<br>
            Even harder to say when you know it's not true<br>
            Even harder to write when you know that tonight<br>
            There were people back home who tried talkin' to you<br>
            But then you ignore them still<br>
            All these questions they're for real<br>
            Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?<br>
            And would you ever kill?<br>
            <br>
            Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br>
            So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br>
