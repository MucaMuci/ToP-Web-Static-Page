            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            <br>
            When the leader of the bad guys sang<br>
            Something soft and soaked in pain<br>
            I heard the echo from his secret hideaway<br>
            He must've forgot to close his door<br>
            As he cranked out those dismal chords<br>
            And his four walls declared him insane<br>
            <br>
            I found my way<br>
            Right time, wrong place<br>
            As I pled my case<br>
            <br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            I know my soul's freezing<br>
            Hell's hot for good reason<br>
            So please, take me<br>
            <br>
            Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh<br>
            Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh<br>
            Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh<br>
            <br>
            Three lights are lit, but the fourth one's out<br>
            I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout<br>
            I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house<br>
            So I head out down a route I think is heading south<br>
            But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth<br>
            I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt<br>
            And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud<br>
            I'm thinking "Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house."<br>
            <br>
            I found my way<br>
            Right time, wrong place<br>
            As I pled my case<br>
            <br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            I know my soul's freezing<br>
            Hell's hot for good reason<br>
            So please<br>
            <br>
            I don't know if this song<br>
            Is a surrender or a revel<br>
            I don't know if this one<br>
            Is about me or the devil<br>
            I don't know if this song<br>
            Is a surrender or a revel<br>
            I don't know if this one<br>
            Is about me or the devil<br>
            Ooooh<br>
            Oh! Yeah<br>
            Ooooh<br>
            <br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free, oh no<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free, oh no<br>
            I know my soul's freezing<br>
            Hell's hot for good reason<br>
            So please<br>
            <br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh<br>
            <br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You're the judge, oh no<br>
