            A shadow tilts its head at me<br>
            Spirits in the dark are waiting<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            <br>
            Be the one, be the one to take my soul and make it undone<br>
            Be the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun<br>
            I know, I know you can bring the fire, I can bring the bones<br>
            I know, I know you make the fire, my bones will make it grow<br>
            <br>
            Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark<br>
            Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark<br>
            Our hometown's in the dark<br>
            <br>
            A shadow tilts its head at me<br>
            Spirits in the dark are waiting<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            <br>
            Put away, put away all the gods your father served today<br>
            Put away, put away your traditions, believe me when I say<br>
            We don't know, we don't know how to put back the power in our soul<br>
            We don't know, we don't know where to find what once was in our bones<br>
            <br>
            Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark<br>
            Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark<br>
            Our hometown's in the dark<br>
            <br>
            My shadow tilts its head at me<br>
            Spirits in the dark are waiting<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            I will let the wind go quietly<br>
            <br>
            Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark<br>
            Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark<br>
