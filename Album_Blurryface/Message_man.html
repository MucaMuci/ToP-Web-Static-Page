            A loser hides behind<br>
            A mask of my disguise<br>
            And who I am today<br>
            Is worse than other times<br>
            <br>
            You don't know what I've done<br>
            I'm wanted and on the run<br>
            I'm wanted and on the run<br>
            So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future<br>
            <br>
            Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions<br>
            Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session<br>

            You don't know my brain<br>
            The way you know my name<br>
            You don't know my heart<br>

            Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?<br>
            People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this<br>
            They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets<br>
            Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line<br>
            It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy<br>
            Who takes every moment he knows he confided in<br>
            Music to use it for others to use it<br>
            You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?<br>
            Life is up here but you comment below<br>
            And the comments will always become common<br>
            Motivation to promote your show's next episode<br>
            So your brain knows to keep going even though hope<br>
            Is far from this moment<br>
            But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head<br>
            Together we're losers, remember the future<br>
            Remember the morning is when night is dead<br>
            <br>
            Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions<br>
            Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session<br>
