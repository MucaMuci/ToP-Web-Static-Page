            All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)<br>
            Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>
            Please don't make any sudden moves<br>
            You don't know the half of the abuse<br>
            All my friends are heathens, take it slow<br>
            Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>       
            Please don't make any sudden moves<br>
            You don't know the half of the abuse<br>
            <br>
            Welcome to the room of people<br>
            Who have rooms of people that they loved one day<br>
            Stocked away<br>
            Just because we check the guns at the door<br>
            Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades<br>
            You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you<br>
            You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you<br>
            You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"<br>
            But after all I've said, please don't forget<br>
            <br>
            All my friends are heathens, take it slow<br>   
            Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>
            Please don't make any sudden moves<br>
            You don't know the half of the abuse<br>
            <br>
            We don't deal with outsiders very well<br>
            They say newcomers have a certain smell<br>
            You have trust issues, not to mention<br>
            They say they can smell your intentions<br>
            You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you<br>
            You'll have some weird people sitting next to you<br>
            You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"<br>
            But after all I've said, please don't forget<br>
            (Watch it, watch it)<br>
            <br>
            All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)<br>

            Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>
            <br>
            Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)<br>
            I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)<br>
            And now they're outside ready to bust (To bust) (And guess what?)<br>   
            It looks like you might be one of us<br>
