            They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"<br>
            But we go where we want to<br>
            They think this thing is a highway, highway<br>
            But will they be alive tomorrow?<br>
            <br>
            They think this thing is a highway<br>
            If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change<br>
            'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good<br>
            I wasn't raised in the hood<br>
            But I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness<br>
            If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this<br>
            Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless<br>
            Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless, honest<br>
            There's a few songs on this record that feel common<br>
            I'm in constant confrontation with what I want an' what is poppin'<br>
            In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency<br>
            My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows<br>
            <br>
            They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"<br>
            But we go where we want to<br>
            They think this thing is a highway, highway<br>
            But will they be alive tomorrow?<br>
            (Will they be alive tomorrow?)<br>
            <br>
            I'm sorry if that question I asked last<br>
            Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack<br>
            He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast<br>
            But let's backtrack, back to this<br>
            Who would you live and die for on that list?<br>
            But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this<br>
            Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality<br>
            If you get in between someone I love an' me<br>
            You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry<br>
            All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless<br>
            Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless<br>
            <br>
