            <br>
            You know where I'm coming from<br>
            Though I am running to you<br>
            All I feel is deny, deny, denial<br>
            <br>
            I wanted to be a better brother, better son<br>
            Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done<br>
            I have none to show to the one I love<br>
            But deny, deny, denial<br>

            Polarize is taking your disguises<br>
            Separating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right<br>
            It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight<br>
            Deny, deny, denial<br>
            <br>
            I wanted to be a better brother, better son<br>
            Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done<br>

            But deny, deny, denial<br>
