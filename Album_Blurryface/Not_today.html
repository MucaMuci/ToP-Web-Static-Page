        <p>
            I don't know why I just feel I'm better off<br>
            Stayin' in the same room I was born in<br>
            I look outside and see a whole world better off<br>
            Without me in it tryin' to transform it<br>
            <br>
            You are out of my mind, oh<br>
            You aren't seein' my side, oh<br>
            You waste all this time tryin' to get to me<br>
            But you are out of my mind, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Listen, I know<br>
            This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds<br>
            But the lyrics are so down<br>
            It's okay though<br>
            Because it represents, wait, better yet it is<br>
            Who I feel I am right now<br>
            <br>
            You are out of my mind, oh<br>
            You aren't seein' my side, oh<br>
            You waste all this time tryin' to get to me<br>
            But you are out of my mind<br>
            <br>
            Heard you say, "Not today"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound<br>
            Heard your voice, "there's no choice"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise<br>
            <br>
            Oh, don't you test me, no<br>
            Just because I play the piano<br>
            Doesn't mean I, I'm not willin' to take you down<br>
            I'm sorry<br>
            <br>
            I'm, I'm out of my mind, oh<br>
            I'm not seein' things right, oh<br>
            I waste all this time tryin' to run from you<br>
            But I'm, I'm out of my mind<br>
            <br>
            Heard you say, "Not today"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound<br>
            Heard your voice, "there's no choice"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise<br>
            <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh<br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh<br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
            <br>
            You are out of my mind<br>
            You aren't seein' my side<br>
            You waste all this time tryin' to get to me<br>
            But you are out of my mind<br>
            <br>
            Heard you say, "Not today"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound<br>
            Heard your voice, "there's no choice"<br>
            Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise<br>
            <br>

            Bah bah bah bah bah (Not today), bah bah bah bah bah (Not today)<br>
            Buh buh bah (No, not today), buh buh bah (Not today)<br>
            (Oh nah nah no) Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah (No) bah (No)<br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
