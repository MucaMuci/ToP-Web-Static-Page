            Sometimes you gotta bleed to know<br>
            That you're alive and have a soul<br>
            But it takes someone to come around to show you how<br>
            <br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, take me higher<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            <br>
            The songs on the radio are okay<br>
            But my taste in music is your face<br>
            An' it takes a song to come around to show you how<br>
            <br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, take me higher<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            <br>
            You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time<br>
            But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine<br>
            I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government<br>
            For not usin' my taxes to fill holes with more cement<br>
            You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time<br>
            But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine<br>
            I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government<br>
            For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement<br>
            Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh<br>
            That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh<br>
            But it takes someone to come around to show you how<br>
            <br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, take me higher<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            <br>
            My heart is my armor<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver<br>
            She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
            Oh, than I've ever been<br>
            My heart is my armor<br>
            She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver<br>
            She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther<br>
            Than I've ever been<br>
