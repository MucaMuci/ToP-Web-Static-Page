            I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard<br>
            I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words<br>
            I wish I found some chords in an order that is new<br>
            I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang<br>
            I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink<br>
            But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think<br>
            <br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            <br>
            Wish we could turn back time to the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out<br>
            (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out<br>
            We're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young<br>
            How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?<br>
            I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it<br>
            Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one<br>
            It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose<br>
            Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam<br>
            But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered<br>
            Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter<br>
            <br>
            My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            <br>
            Wish we could turn back time to the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out<br>
            (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            We used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
            We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away<br>
            Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face<br>  
            Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah<br>
            We used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
            We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away<br>
            Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face<br>

            When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
            We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money<br>
            Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
            We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money<br>
            Used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
            We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away<br>
