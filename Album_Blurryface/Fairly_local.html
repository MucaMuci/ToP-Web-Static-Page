            I'm fairly local, I've been around<br>
            I've seen the streets you're walkin' down<br>
            I'm fairly local, good people now<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
            <br>
            I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will<br>
            They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill<br>
            Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance<br>
            Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance<br>
            <br>
            Yo, this song will never be on the radio<br>
            Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote<br>
            It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional<br>
            Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral<br>
            The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold<br>
            It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional<br>
            <br>
            I'm fairly local, I've been around<br>
            I've seen the streets you're walkin' down<br>
            I'm fairly local, good people now<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
            <br>
            I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight<br>
            I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try<br>
            I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance<br>
            Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance<br>
            <br>
            Yo, this song will never be on the radio<br>
            Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote<br>

            I'm fairly local, good people now<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah<br>
            I'm fairly local, good people now<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, good people now<br>
            Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, kill people now<br>
