        <p>
            There's an infestation in my mind's imagination<br>
            I hope that they choke on smoke<br>
            'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement<br>
            This is not rap, this is not hip-hop<br>
            Just another attempt to make the voices stop<br>
            Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'<br>
            'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'<br>
            This doesn't mean I lost my dream<br>
            It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean<br>
            <br>
            Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm<br>
            Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)<br>
            <br>
            Can you save, can you save my<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>
            Can you save, can you save my<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>
            For me, for me (Uh)<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>

            <br>
            Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said<br>
            If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead<br>
            Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp an' a hunch<br>
            Sayin' stuff like, "You only live once"<br>
            You've got one time to figure it out<br>
            One time to twist and one time to shout<br>
            One time to think and I say we start now<br>
            Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about<br>
            <br>
            Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm<br>
            Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)<br>
            <br>
            Can you save, can you save my<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>
            Can you save, can you save my<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>
            For me, for me (Huh)<br>

            For me, for me (Huh)<br>
            Can you save my heavydirtysoul?<br>
            <br>
            Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit<br>
