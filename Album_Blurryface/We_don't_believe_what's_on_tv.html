            Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br>
            <br>
            We don't believe what's on TV<br>
            Because it's what we want to see<br>
            An' what we want we know we can't believe<br>
            We have all learned to kill our dreams<br>
            <br>
            I need to know<br>
            That when I fail you'll still be here, mmm<br>
            'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds<br>
            An' we'll make money selling your hair<br>
            <br>
            I don't care what's in your hair<br>
            I just wanna know what's on your mind<br>
            I used to say I wanna die before I'm old<br>
            But because of you, I might think twice<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br>
            <br>
            Alright, second verse<br>
            What if my dream does not happen?<br>
            Would I just change what I've told my friends?<br>
            Don't want to know who I would be<br>
            When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep<br>
            <br>
            I need to know<br>
            That when I fail you'll still be here, oh<br>
            'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds<br>
            An' we'll make money selling your hair<br>
            <br>
            But I don't care what's in your hair<br>
            I just wanna know what's on your mind<br>
            I used to say I wanna die before I'm old<br>
            But because of you, I might think twice<br>
            I don't care what's in your hair<br>
