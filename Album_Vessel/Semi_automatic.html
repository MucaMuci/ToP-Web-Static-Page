            Night falls, with gravity<br>
            The earth turns, from sanity<br>
            Taking my only friend I know<br>
            He leaves a lot, his name is Hope<br>
            <br>
            I'm never what I like<br>
            I'm double-sided<br>
            And I just can't hide<br>
            I kinda like it<br>
            When I make you cry<br>
            'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside<br>
            <br>
            The horrors of the night melt away<br>
            Under the warm glow of survival of the day<br>
            Then we move on<br>
            My shadow grows taller along with my fears<br>
            And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near<br>
            When the sun is climbing window sills<br>
            And the silver lining rides the hills<br>
            I will be saved for one whole day<br>
            Until the sun makes the hills its grave<br>
            <br>
            I'm never what I like<br>
            I'm double-sided<br>
            And I just can't hide<br>
            I kinda like it<br>
            When I make you cry<br>
            Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside<br>
            I'm never what I like!<br>
            I'm double-sided<br>
            And I just can't hide<br>
            I kinda like it<br>
            When I make you cry<br>
            Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind<br>
            <br>
            I'm semi-automatic<br>
            My prayers schizophrenic<br>
            But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on<br>
            I'm semi-automatic<br>
            My prayers schizophrenic<br>
            But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live, yeah, yeah, yeah!<br>
            I'm semi-automatic<br>
            My prayers schizophrenic<br>
            But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on<br>
            I'm semi-automatic<br>
            My prayers schizophrenic<br>
            But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on...<br>
            <br>
            By the time the night wears off, the dust is down<br>
            And shadows burn<br>
            I will rise and stand my ground<br>
            Waiting for the night's return<br>
            <br>
            I'm never what I like<br>
            I'm double-sided<br>
            And I just can't hide<br>
            I kinda like it<br>
            When I make you cry<br>
            Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside<br>
            I'm never what I like!<br>
            I'm double-sided<br>
            And I just can't hide<br>
            I kinda like it<br>
            When I make you cry<<br>
            Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind<br>
