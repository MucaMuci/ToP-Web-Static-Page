        <p>
            I want to drive away<br>
            In the night, headlights call my name<br>
            <br>
            I, I'll never be, be what you see inside<br>
            You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified<br>
            You say that you are close, is close the closest star?<br>
            You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far<br>
            <br>
            And I'll fall, and I'll break<br>
            And I'll fake, all I wanna<br>
            (Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey...)<br>
            And I'll fall down, and I'll break down<br>
            And I'll fake you out, all I wanna<br>
            <br>
            I'm so afraid of what you have to say<br>
            'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space<br>
            <br>
            I'll never be, be what you see inside<br>
            You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified<br>
            You say that you are close, is close the closest star?<br>
            You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far<br>
            <br>
            And I'll fall, and I'll break<br>
            And I'll fake, all I wanna<br>
            (Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey...)<br>
            And I'll fall down, and I'll break down<br>
            And I'll fake you out, all I wanna<br>
            <br>
            It's the same game today as it always is<br>
            I don't give you space to speak my name explaining this<br>
            And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines<br>
            That remind me of all the times... I have committed<br>
            Dirty, dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted<br>
            To what I've done and what I'm doing<br>
            I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing<br>
            And believe me, that's what all the kids are doing<br>
            What kids are doing, they're killing themselves<br>
            They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell<br>
            And if you're one of them, then you're one of me<br>
            And you would do almost anything just to feel free... am I right?<br>
            Of course I am, convince me otherwise, it'll take all night<br>
            Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say<br>
            Our brains are sick but that's okay<br>
            <br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll break you down)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            And I'll fall (I'll fake you out)<br>
            And I'll break (I'll fake you out)<br>
            And I'll fake (I'll fake you out)<br>
            All I wanna (All I wanna)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll break you down)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll fake you out)<br>
            (I'll break you down)<br>
            <br>
            All I wanna<br>
            Yeah, and I'll fall down, and I'll break down<br>
            And I'll fake you out, all I wanna<br>
            Yeah, and I'll fall down, and I'll break down<br>
            And I'll fake you out, all I wanna<br>
            <br>
            I'm so afraid of what you have to say<br>
            'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space<br>
