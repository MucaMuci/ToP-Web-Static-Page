            Am I the only one I know<br>
            Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?<br>
            Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone...<br>
            <br>
            I-I-I-I've got a migraine<br>
            And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways<br>
            Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays<br>
            'Cause Sundays are my suicide days<br>
            I don't know why they always seem so dismal<br>
            Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle<br>
            Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed<br>
            Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head<br>
            Let it be said what the headache represents<br>
            It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test<br>
            Being tested by a ruthless examinant<br>
            That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts<br>
            I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock<br>
            It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead<br>
            And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head<br>
            <br>
            Am I the only one I know<br>
            Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?<br>
            Shadows will scream that I'm alone<br>
            But I know, we've made it this far... kid<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            <br>
            I am not as fine as I seem, pardon<br>
            Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens<br>
            Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me<br>
            A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees<br>
            Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait<br>
            Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead<br>
            And how it is a door that holds back contents<br>
            That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent<br>
            Behind my eyelids are islands of violence<br>
            My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find<br>
            I did not know it was such a violent island<br>
            Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions<br>
            They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin<br>
            And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win<br>
            I begin to assemble what weapons I can find<br>
            'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind<br>
            <br>
            Am I the only one I know<br>
            Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?<br>
            Shadows will scream that I'm alone<br>
            But I know, we've made it this far... kid<br>
            <br>
            (Ah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            (Oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            <br>
            And I will say that we should take a day to break away<br>
            From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone<br>
            And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it<br>
            And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone<br>
            And I will say that we should take a day to break away<br>
            From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone<br>
            And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it<br>
            And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone<br>
            <br>
            Am I the only one I know, oh<br>
            Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?<br>
            Shadows will scream that I'm alone<br>
            But I know, we've made it this far... kid<br>
            <br>
            Made it this far<br>
            Made it this<br>
