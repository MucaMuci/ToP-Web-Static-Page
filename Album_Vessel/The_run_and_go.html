            I can't take them on my own, my own<br>
            Pa, I'm not the one you know, you know<br>
            I have killed a man and all I know is<br>
            I am on the run and go<br>
            <br>
            Don't wanna call you in the nighttime<br>
            Don't wanna give you all my pieces<br>
            Don't wanna hand you all my trouble<br>
            Don't wanna give you all my demons<br>
            You'll have to watch me struggle<br>
            From several rooms away<br>
            But tonight, I'll need you to stay<br>
            <br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do<br>
            <br>
            I am up against the wall, the wall<br>
            Pa, I hear them coming down the hall<br>
            I have killed a man and all I know is<br>
            I am on the run and go<br>
            <br>
            Don't wanna call you in the nighttime<br>
            Don't wanna give you all my pieces<br>
            Don't wanna hand you all my trouble<br>
            Don't wanna give you all my demons<br>

            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
            Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do, do, do<br>
            <br>
            Cold nights under siege from accusations<br>
            Cerebral thunder and one-way conversations<br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            <br>
            Don't wanna call you in the nighttime<br>   
            Don't wanna give you all my pieces<br>
            Don't wanna hand you all my trouble<br>
            Don't wanna give you all my demons<br>
            You'll have to watch me struggle<br>

            Tonight, I'll need you to stay<br>
            Tonight, I'll need you to stay<br>
            Tonight, I'll need you to stay<br>
            Tonight, I'll need you to stay!<br>
