        <p>
            I do not know why I would go<br>
            In front of you and hide my soul<br>
            'Cause you're the only one who knows it<br>
            Yeah, you're the only one who knows it<br>
            And I will hide behind my pride<br>
            I don't know why I think I can lie<br>
            'Cause there's a screen on my chest<br>
            Yeah there's a screen on my chest<br>
            <br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            I'm trying to be so cool<br>
            Everything together trying to be so cool<br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            Oh, I'm standing in front of you<br>
            I'm trying to be so cool<br>
            Everything together trying to be so cool<br>
            <br>
            I can't see past my own nose<br>
            I'm seeing everything in slo-mo<br>
            Look out below crashing down to the ground<br>
            Just like a vertical locomotive, that's a train<br>
            Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?<br>
            A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane<br>
            My flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people<br>
            Who know if I flow on a song, I'll get no radio play<br>
            While you're doing fine, there's some people and I<br>
            Who have a really tough time getting through this life<br>
            So excuse us while we sing to the sky<br>
            <br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            I'm trying to be so cool<br>
            Everything together trying to be so cool<br>
            I'm standing in front of you<br>
            Oh I'm standing in front of you<br>
            Oh I'm trying to be so cool<br>
            Everything together trying to be so cool<br>
            <br>
            We're broken, we're broken<br>
            We're broken, we're broken people<br>
            We're broken people, yeah<br>
            We're broken, we're broken<br>
            We're broken, we're broken people<br>   
            We're broken people, yeah<br>
            We're broken, we're broken<br>
