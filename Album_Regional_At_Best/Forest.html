            Oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh<br>
            Oh<br>
            <br>
            I don't know why I feed on emotion<br>
            There's a stomach inside my brain<br>
            I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to<br>
            Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?<br>
            Oh, does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name, your name?<br>
            <br>
            I scream, you scream<br>
            We all scream, 'cause we're terrified<br>
            Of what's around the corner<br>
            We stay in place<br>
            'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives<br>
            So let's think of something better<br>
            <br>
            Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus<br>
            One that everybody knows<br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire<br>
            Singing songs that nobody wrote<br>
            <br>
            My brain has given up, white flags are hoisted<br>
            I took some food for thought, it might be poisoned<br>
            The stomach in my brain throws up onto the page<br>
            Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?<br>
            Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?<br>
            <br>
            I scream, you scream<br>
            We all scream, 'cause we're terrified<br>
            Of what's around the corner<br>
            We stay in place<br>
            'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives<br>
            So let's think of something better (Better)<br>
            Oh<br>
            <br>
            Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus<br>
            One that everybody knows<br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire<br>
            Singing songs that nobody wrote<br>
            <br>
            Quickly moving towards the storm, moving forward, torn<br>
            Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for<br>
            I don't understand why everything I adore<br>
            Takes a different form when I squint my eyes<br>
            Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes<br>
            And your eyelashes make it look a little not right<br>
            And then when just enough light comes from just the right side<br>
            And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?<br>
            This is not what you're supposed to see<br>
            Please, remember me?<br>
            I am supposed to be<br>
            King of a kingdom, or swinging on a swing<br>
            Something happened to my imagination<br>
            The situation's becoming dire<br>
            My tree house is on fire<br>
            And for some reason I smell gas on my hands<br>
            This is not what I had planned<br>
            This is not what I had planned<br>
            Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus (Forest, chorus)<br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire<br>
            Singing songs that nobody wrote<br>
            <br>
            Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus<br>
            One that everybody knows, yeah<br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire<br>
            Singing songs that nobody wrote<br>
            <br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire<br>
            Hands held higher, we'll be on fire (Fire)<br>
