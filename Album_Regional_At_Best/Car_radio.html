        <p>
            I ponder of something great<br>
            My lungs will fill and then deflate<br>
            They fill with fire, exhale desire<br>
            I know it's dire, my time today<br>
            I have these thoughts so often, I ought<br>
            To replace that slot with what I once bought<br>
            'Cause somebody stole my car radio<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            <br>
            Sometimes quiet is violent<br>
            I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside<br>
            It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream<br>
            Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream<br>
            I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me<br>
            I'm forced to deal with what I feel<br>
            There is no distraction to mask what is real<br>
            I could pull the steering wheel<br>
            <br>
            I have these thoughts so often, I ought<br>
            To replace that slot with what I once bought<br>
            'Cause somebody stole my car radio<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            <br>
            I ponder of something terrifying<br>
            'Cause this, time there's no sound to hide behind<br>
            I find over the course of our human existence<br>
            One thing consists of consistence<br>
            And it's that we're all battling fear<br>
            Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here<br>
            Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking<br>
            I liked it better when my car had sound<br>
            There are things we can do<br>
            But from the things that work there are only two<br>
            And from the two that we choose to do<br>
            Peace will win and fear will lose<br>
            And there's faith and there's sleep<br>
            We need to pick one please because<br>
            Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think<br>
            And for us to think is to be alive<br>
            And I will try with every rhyme<br>
            To come across like I am dying<br>
            To let you know you need to try to think<br>
            <br>
            I have these thoughts so often, I ought<br>
            To replace that slot with what I once bought<br>
            'Cause somebody stole my car radio<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            <br>
            Woah, oh woah oh<br>
            Woah, oh woah oh<br>
            Woah, oh woah oh<br>
            Woah, oh woah oh<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            And now I just sit<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            And now I just sit in silence<br>
            And now I just sit<br>
            <br>
            I ponder of something great<br>
            My lungs will fill and then deflate<br>
