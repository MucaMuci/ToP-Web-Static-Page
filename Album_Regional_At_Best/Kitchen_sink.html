            Nobody thinks what I think, nobody dreams when they blink<br>
            Think things on the brink of blasphemy, I'm my own shrink<br>
            Think things are after me, I'm my catastrophe<br>
            At my kitchen sink<br>
            You don't know what that means<br>
            Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me<br>
            Okay, friend?<br>
            Are you searching for purpose?<br>
            Then write something, yeah, it might be worthless<br>
            Then paint something, and it might be wordless<br>
            Pointless curses, nonsense verses<br>
            You'll see purpose start to surface<br>
            No one else is dealing with your demons<br>
            Meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend<br>
            <br>
            Go away, go away<br>
            Go away, go away<br>
            Leave me alone, leave me alone<br>
            Leave me alone, leave me alone<br>
            Leave me alone<br>
            Leave me alone<br>
            Leave me alone<br>
            <br>
            Nobody thinks what you think, no one<br>
            Empathy might be on the brink of extinction<br>
            They will play a game and say they know what you're going through<br>
            And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say they don't know you<br>
            And neither do I, so here's a prime example of a stand-up guy who<br>
            Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time<br>
            Here's my brother, and his head's screwed up, but that's all right<br>
            <br>
            Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em<br>
            I'm winning a momentary, sinning a moment passing after<br>
            A re-beginning moment's mending memories<br>
            Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me<br>
            My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man<br>
            Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me<br>
            The better the rhythm, the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle<br>
            Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?<br>
            <br>
            Go away, go away<br>
            Go away, go away<br>
            Leave me alone, leave me alone<br>
            Leave me alone, leave me alone<br>
            <br>
            Leave me alone<br>
            Don't leave me alone<br>
