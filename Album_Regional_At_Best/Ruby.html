            Ruby, I hope I see you, I've waited all this week<br>
            For you to walk my way, your soul will capture me<br>
            Your mama painted your room a shade of pink, she said<br>
            But with your great arrival, that shade has turned to red<br>
            <br>
            Ruby, take my hand, please lead me to the Promised Land<br>
            Tell me, where am I from? Your eyes say, sha-da-dee-da-dum<br>
            Ruby, you're royalty, in your homeland, they all call you queen<br>
            Tell me, where are you from? Your eyes say, sha-da-dee-da-dum<br>
            <br>
            You're an angel fallen down<br>
            Won't you tell us of the clouds?<br>
            You have fallen from the sky<br>
            How high, how high?<br>
            You're an angel fallen down<br>
            Won't you tell us of the clouds?<br>
            You have fallen from the sky<br>
            How high, how high?<br>
            (How high, how high?)<br>
            <br>
            You're true and pure<br>
            You hold the cure<br>
            We're all diseased<br>
            You hold the key<br>
            <br>
            You're an angel fallen down<br>
            Won't you tell us of the clouds?<br>
            You have fallen from the sky<br>
            How high, how high? (How high)?<br>
            <br>
