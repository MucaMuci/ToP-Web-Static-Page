        <p>
            I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty"<br>
            I bet a lot of me was lost, "T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted<br>
            I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got<br>
            Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!<br>
            I must've forgot, you can't trust me<br>
            I'm open a moment and closed when you show it<br>
            Before you know it, I'm lost at sea<br>
            And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds<br>
            You should take my life, you should take my soul<br>
            <br>
            You are surrounding, all my surroundings<br>
            Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain<br>
            You are surrounding, all my surroundings<br>
            Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes<br>
            And I'll be holding onto you<br>
            And I'll be holding onto you<br>
            <br>
            Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'<br>
            'Cause the next moment before you know it<br>
            Time is slowin' and it's frozen still<br>
            And the windowsill looks really nice, right?<br>
            You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?<br>
            Fight it, take the pain, ignite it<br>
            Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine<br>
            And tie it to a tree tell it, "You belong to me<br>
            This ain't a noose, this is a leash<br>
            And I have news for you, you must obey me!"<br>
            <br>
            You are surrounding, all my surroundings<br>
            Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain<br>
            You are surrounding, all my surroundings<br>
            Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes<br>
            <br>
            Entertain my faith, entertain my faith<br>
            Entertain my faith, entertain my faith<br>
            Entertain my faith, entertain my faith<br>
            Entertain my faith, entertain my faith<br>
            Entertain my faith, entertain my faith<br>
            <br>
            Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?<br>
            Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought<br>
            Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?<br>
            It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat<br>
            Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?<br>

            Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?<br>
            It ain't the speakers that bump hard, it's our hearts that make the beat<br>

            <br>
            And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you<br>
            And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you<br>
            And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you<br>
            And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you<br>
