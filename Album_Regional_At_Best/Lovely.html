            You say things with your mouth, cobwebs and flies come out<br>
            I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow<br>
            Luckily I can read your mind, flies and cobwebs unwind<br>
            They will not take you down, they will not cast you out, out<br>
            <br>
            Dear friend, here we are again<br>
            Pretending to understand how you think your world is ending<br>
            Sending signals and red flags in waves<br>
            It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days<br>
            I'll pray that one day you'll see<br>
            The only difference between life and dying<br>
            Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do<br>
            So try to love me and I'll try to save you<br>
            <br>
            Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride<br>
            I will make you believe you are lovely<br>
            Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride<br>
            I will make you believe you are lovely<br>
            <br>
            Your redemption won't grow stale<br>
            We are now just setting sail<br>
            On the seas of what we fear<br>
            Treason now is growing near to me<br>
            <br>
            I'm coming clean<br>
            God, hit me straight on<br>
            God, hit me straight on<br>
            <br>
            Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride<br>
            I will make you believe you are lovely<br>
            Won't you stay alive? I'll take you on a ride<br>

            Luckily I can read your mind<br>
            <br>
            Don't be gone, don't be gone<br>
            Don't be gone, don't be gone<br>
            Don't be gone<br>
