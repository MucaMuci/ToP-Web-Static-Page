        <p>
            I know what you think in the morning<br>
            When the sun shines on the ground<br>
            And shows what you have done<br>
            It shows where your mind has gone<br>
            And you swear to your parents<br>
            That it will never happen again<br>
            I know, I know-ow-ow what that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow<br>
            <br>
            That you all have guns<br>
            And you never put the safety on<br>
            And you all have plans<br>
            To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            But I can't, but I can't when you all have<br>
            Guns for hands, yeah<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            But I can't, but I can't when you all have<br>
            Guns for hands, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Let's take this a second at a time<br>
            Let's take this one song, this one rhyme<br>
            Together, let's breathe<br>
            Together, to the beat<br>
            But there's hope out the window<br>
            So that's where we'll go<br>
            Let's go outside and all join hands<br>
            But until then you'll never understand<br>
            <br>
            That you all have guns<br>
            And you never put the safety on<br>
            And you all have plans<br>
            To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>            
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            But I can't, but I can't when you all have<br>
            Guns for hands, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            Whoo!<br>
            Da-da-da-da-da...<br>
            Da-da-da-da-da...<br>
            Da-da-da-da-da, ah uh...<br>
            Da-da-da-da-da...<br>
            <br>
            We've turned our hands to guns<br>
            Traded our thumbs for ammunition<br>
            I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition<br>
            Cause when the sun sets<br>
            It upsets what's left of my invested interest<br>
            Interested in putting my fingers to my head<br>
            The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids<br>
            Fused at the wrist<br>
            I simply tell them they should shoot at this<br>
            Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's<br>
            Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist<br>
            <br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep<br>
            But I can't, but I can't when you all have<br>
            Guns for hands, yeah<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)<br>
            I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)<br>
            But I can't, but I can't when you all have<br>
            Guns for hands, yeah<br>
