            We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids<br>
            Culture forbids<br>
            We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is<br>
            Fall off the grid<br>
            <br>
            We live for the night's decor<br>
            It reveals what we dream of<br>
            <br>
            I know there's someone at the door<br>
            They called for help, of this I'm sure<br>
            But do I want to say goodbye<br>
            To all the glowing eyes?<br>
            I'm holding on to what I know<br>
            And what I know, I must let go<br>
            But I would rather play a song<br>
            For the eyes to sing along<br>
            The eyes to sing along, long, long<br>
            <br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            <br>
            We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great<br>
            I know some people who know people who are flying straight<br>
            But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression<br>
            While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again<br>
            <br>

            This room is far too dark for us to stay around<br>
            Redemption's not that far, and darkness is going down<br>

            Their eyes will sing along, long, long<br>
            Make them stop<br>
            Make them stop<br>
            Make them stop<br>
            Make them stop<br>
            Make them stop<br>
