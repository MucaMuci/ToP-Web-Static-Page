        <p>
            I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy<br>
            To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing<br>
            I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling<br>
            Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding<br>
            I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!" on my knees repeatedly asking<br>
            Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?<br>
            I don't wanna be the one<br>
            Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon<br>
            Take this weapon forged in darkness<br>
            Some see a pen, I see a harpoon<br>
            <br>
            I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight<br>
            <br>
            Why am I not scared in the morning?<br>
            I don't hear those voices calling<br>
            I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out<br>
            I swear I heard demons yelling<br>
            Those crazy words they were spelling<br>
            They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone<br>
            <br>
            But I tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?<br>
            Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"<br>
            Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
            I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
            I'll tell 'em<br>
            <br>
            On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake<br>
            As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate<br>
            The start of a day when we put on our face<br>
            A mask that portrays that we don't need grace<br>
            On the eve of a day that is bigger than us<br>
            But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must<br>
            And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead<br>
            Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!"<br>
            <br>
            I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times<br>
            Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime<br>
            I'm afraid to tell you who I adore<br>
            Won't tell you who I'm singing towards<br>
            Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four<br>
            <br>
            I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight<br>
            <br>
            Why am I not scared in the morning?<br>
            I don't hear those voices calling<br>
            I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out<br>
            I swear I heard demons yelling<br>
            Those crazy words they were spelling<br>
            They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone<br>
            <br>
            But I tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?<br>
            Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"<br>
            Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
            I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
            <br>
            I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me, I will set my soul on fire<br>
            What have I become? I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em<br>
            I'll tell 'em, please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
            I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry<br>
