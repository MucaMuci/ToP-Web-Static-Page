            She asked me, "Son, when I grow old<br>
            Will you buy me a house of gold?<br>
            And when your father turns to stone<br>
            Will you take care of me?"<br>
            <br>
            She asked me, "Son, when I grow old<br>
            Will you buy me a house of gold?<br>
            And when your father turns to stone<br>
            Will you take care of me?"<br>
            <br>
            I will make you queen of everything you see<br>
            I'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease<br>
            <br>
            Let's say we up and left this town<br>
            And turned our future upside down<br>
            We'll make pretend that you and me<br>
            Lived ever after happily<br>
            <br>
            She asked me, "Son, when I grow old<br>
            Will you buy me a house of gold?<br>
            And when your father turns to stone<br>
            Will you take care of me?"<br>
            <br>
            I will make you queen of everything you see<br>
            I'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease<br>
            <br>
            And since we know that dreams are dead<br>
            And life turns plans up on their head<br>
            I will plan to be a bum<br>
            So I just might become someone<br>
            <br>
            She asked me, "Son, when I grow old<br>
            Will you buy me a house of gold?<br>
            And when your father turns to stone<br>
            Will you take care of me?"<br>
