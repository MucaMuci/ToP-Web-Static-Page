            Panic on the brain, world has gone insane<br>
            Things are starting to get heavy, mm<br>
            I can't help but think I haven't felt this way<br>
            Since I asked you to go steady<br>
            <br>
            Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine?<br>
            Or is this the way it ends?<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I told you my level of concern<br>
            But you walked by like you never heard<br>
            And you could bring down my level of concern<br>
            Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay<br>
            <br>
