            Turn away if you could get me a drink<br>
            Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded<br>
            Call my aunt Marie, help her gather all my things<br>
            And bury me in all my favorite colors<br>
            My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you<br>
            'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you<br>
            <br>
            (My sisters and my brothers, still)<br>
            I will not kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)<br>
            Kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)<br>
            <br>
            Turn away 'cause I'm awful just to see<br>
            And all my hairs abandoned all my body<br>
            All my agony know that I will never marry<br>
            Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo<br>
            I'm counting down the days to go, this just ain't livin'<br>
            And I just hope you know<br>
            <br>
            I will not kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)<br>
            Kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)<br>

            If you say (If you say)<br>
            Goodbye today (Goodbye today)<br>
            I'll ask you to be true (I'll ask you to be true)<br>
            'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you<br>
            Yes, the hardest part of this...<br>
            <br>
            I will not kiss you (Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded<br>
            Call my (Call my, call my, call my, call my)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)<br>
            Kiss you (Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you)<br>
            Lips are chapped and faded<br>
            Call my (Call my, call my, call my, call my)<br>
