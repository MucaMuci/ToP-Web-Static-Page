            Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet<br>
            And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe<br>
            And though I feed on things that fell<br>
            You can learn to levitate with just a little help<br>

            Come down, come down<br>
            Cowards only come through when the hour's late<br>
            And everyone's asleep, mind you<br>
            Now show up, show up<br>
            I know I shouldn't say this<br>
            But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man<br>
            Come down, come down<br>
            Cowards only come through when the hour's late<br>
            And everyone's asleep, mind you<br>
            Now show up, show up<br>
            I know I shouldn't say this<br>
            But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man<br>
            <br>
            Danger in the fabric of this thing I made<br>
            I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late<br>
            My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made<br>
            Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say<br>
            They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above<br>
            But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought<br>
            No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train<br>
            I got back what I once bought back<br>
            In that slot, I won't need to replace<br>
            This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today<br>
            Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain<br>
            Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through<br>
            And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all<br>
            I thought I could depend on my weekends<br>
            On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on<br>
            Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges<br>
            Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways<br>
            Keep your wooden wedges under doors<br> 
            Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight<br>
            Wait, habits here too, youâ€™re the worst, your structure compensates<br>
            But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two<br>
            At least they all know all they hear comes from a place<br>
            <br>
            Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet<br>
