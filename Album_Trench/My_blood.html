            When everyone you thought you knew<br>
            Deserts your fight, I'll go with you<br>
            You're facin' down a dark hall<br>
            I'll grab my light<br>
            <br>
            And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            <br>
            Surrounded and up against a wall<br>
            I'll shred 'em all and go with you<br>
            When choices end, you must defend<br>
            I'll grab my bat<br>
            <br>
            And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
            Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
            Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
            Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>
            <br>
            If there comes a day<br>
            People posted up at the end of your driveway<br>
            They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name<br>
            I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through<br>
            Did they know I was grown with you?<br>
            If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you<br>
            Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Stay with me, no, you don't need to run<br>
            Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run<br>

            <br>    
            If you find yourself in a lion's den<br>
            I'll jump right in and pull my pin<br>
            <br>
            And go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            I'll go with you, I'll go with you<br>
            (You don't need to run)<br>
