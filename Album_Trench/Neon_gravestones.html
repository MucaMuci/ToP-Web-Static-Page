            Call (Call)<br>
            Call (Call)<br>
            Call (Call)<br>
            <br>
            What's my problem?<br>
            Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom<br>
            Underneath the insane asylum<br>
            Keep your wits about you while you got 'em<br>
            'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'<br>
            And my problem?<br>
            We glorify those even more when they...<br>
            My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win<br>
            And right before we turn on them<br>
            We give 'em the highest of praise<br>
            And hang their banner from the ceiling<br>
            Communicating, further engraving<br>
            An earlier grave is an optional way, no<br>
            <br>

            Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
            Call (For my bones)<br>
            Call, call, call (Call, call, call)<br>
            Call (Call)<br>
            Call (Call)<br>
            <br>
            What's my problem?<br>
            Don't get it twisted<br>
            It's with the people we praise who may have assisted<br>
            I could use the streams and extra conversations<br>
            I could give up, and boost up my reputation<br>
            I could go out with a bang<br>  
            They would know my name<br>
            They would host and post a celebration<br>
            My opinion will not be lenient<br>
            My opinion, it's real convenient<br>
            Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action<br>
            We don't get enough love?<br>
            Well, they get a fraction<br>
            They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?<br>
            I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"<br>
            <br>

            Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
            Call (For my bones)<br>
            Call, call, call<br>
            <br>
            Promise me this (Call, call)<br>
            If I lose to myself<br>
            You won't mourn a day<br>
            And you'll move onto someone else<br>
            Promise me this<br>
            If I lose to myself<br>
            You won't mourn a day<br>
            And you'll move onto someone else<br>
            (Ooh, call, ooh, call)<br>

            Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
            (Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
            Neon gravestones try to call<br>
            (Neon gravestones try to call)<br>
            Neon gravestones try to call for my bones<br>
            (Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)<br>
            <br>
            'Cause they won't get them<br>
            No, they won't get them<br>
            They won't get them<br>
            But they won't get them<br>
            <br>
            Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness<br>
            Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us<br>
            But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness<br>
            Could we give this some room for a new point of view?<br>
            And could it be true that some could be tempted<br>
            To use this mistake as a form of aggression?<br>
            A form of succession?<br>
            A form of a weapon?<br>
            Thinking "I'll teach them"<br>
            Well, I'm refusing the lesson<br>
            It won't resonate in our minds<br>
            I'm not disrespecting what was left behind<br>
            Just pleading that it does not get glorified<br>
            Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high<br>
            Find your grandparents or someone of age<br>
            Pay some respects for the path that they paved<br>
            To life, they were dedicated<br>
            Now, that should be celebrated<br>
