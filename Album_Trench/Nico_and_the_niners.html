            East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low<br>
            East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br>
            East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that<br>
            Dema don't control us, Dema don't control<br>
            East is up<br>
            <br>
            They want to make you forget<br>
            They want to make you forget<br>
            Save your razorblades now, not yet<br>
            Save your razorblades now, not yet<br>
            <br>
            I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady<br>
            I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh<br>
            I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high<br>
            I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh<br>
            East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low<br>
            East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br>
            East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that<br>
            Dema don't control us, Dema don't control<br>
            I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady<br>
            I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh<br>
            I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high<br>
            I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh<br>
            <br>
            I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady<br>
            Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh<br>
            I'm so high, I'm so high<br>
            So high, I'm so high<br>
            Fire, Nico and the Niners<br>
            <br>
            What I say when I want to be enough<br>
            What a beautiful day for making a break for it<br>
            We'll find a way to pay for it<br>
            Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores<br>
            Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor<br>
            And start a concert, a complete diversion<br>
            Start a mob and you can be quite certain<br>
            We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>
            No, no<br>
            We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>
            No, no<br>
            We'll win but not everyone will get out<br>

            I'm so high, so high<br>
