        <p>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            Traveling around this sun<br>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            I wish she knew you<br>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            Now everybody knows<br>
            You were one of those classic ones, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Alright<br>
            You're a legend in my own mind<br>
            My middle name, my goodbye<br>
            <br>
            You were here when I wrote this<br>
            But the masters and mixes<br>
            Will take too long to finish to show you<br>
            I'm sorry I did not visit<br>
            Did not know how to take it<br>
            When your eyes did not know me<br>  
            Like I know you<br>
            <br>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            Travelin' around this sun<br>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)<br>
            You were one of those classic ones<br>
            Now everybody knows (Wish she knew you)<br>
            You were one of those classic ones, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Alright<br>
            You're a legend in my own mind<br>
            My middle name, my goodbye<br>
            Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, oh<br>
            Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye<br>
            Alright (wish she knew you)<br>
            You're a legend in my own mind<br>
            My middle name, my goodbye<br>
            <br>
            Then the day that it happened, I recorded this last bit<br>
            I look forward to having a lunch with you again<br>
