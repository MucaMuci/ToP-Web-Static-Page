            Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed<br>
            My interior world needs to sanitize<br>
            I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate<br>
            I'll record my step through for my basement tapes<br>
            <br>
            Nice to know my kind will be on my side<br>
            I don't believe the hype<br>
            And you know you’re a terrible sight<br>
            But you'll be just fine<br>
            Just don't believe the hype<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, they might be talking behind your head<br>
            Your exterior world can step off instead<br>
            It might take some friends and a warmer shirt<br>
            But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt<br>
            <br>
            Nice to know my kind will be on my side<br>
            I don't believe the hype<br>
            And you know you're a terrible sight<br>
            But you'll be just fine<br>
            Just don't believe the hype<br>
            (Take me with you)<br>
            <br>
            (We’re gonna rely pretty heavily<br>
            On technology<br>
            And energy<br>
            To cover up the fact that we’re only two people<br>
            But I think we can do it)<br>
            <br>
            No, I don't know which way I’m going<br>
            But I can hear my way around<br>
            No, I don't know which way I'm going<br>
            But I can hear my way around<br>
