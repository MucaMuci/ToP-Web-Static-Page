            Move!<br>
            <br>
            Can't stop thinking about if and when I die<br>
            For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries<br>
            For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow<br>
            And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow<br>
            We're surrounded and we're hounded<br>
            There's no above, or under, or around it<br>
            For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve<br>
            And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see<br>
            For if and when we go above, the question still remains<br>
            Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?<br>
            And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder<br>
            But until that time, I'll try to sing this<br>
            <br>
            If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            What they throw at me's too slow<br>
            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            I'm just a ghost<br>
            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            A defense mechanism mode<br>
            <br>
            He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki<br>
            He's got no friends close but those who know him most know<br>
            He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy<br>
            When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me<br>
            Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded<br>
            There's no above or a secret door<br>
            What are we here for<br>
            If not to run straight through all our tormentors?<br>
            But until that time, I'll try to sing this<br>
            <br>
            If I keep moving, they won't know<br>
            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            What they throw at me's too slow<br>

            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            A defense mechanism mode<br>
            I'll morph to someone else<br>
            <br>
            Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me<br>
            Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony<br>
            Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes<br>
            Count to infinity, ones and zeroes<br>
            I'm surrounded and I'm hounded<br>
            There's no above, or under, or around it<br>
            For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve<br>
