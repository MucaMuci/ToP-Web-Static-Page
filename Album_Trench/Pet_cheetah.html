            I am on an island, no one to confide<br>
            Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line<br>
            I can feel pressure start to possess my mind<br>
            So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise<br>
            <br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            <br>
            I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement<br>  
            I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason<br>
            Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats<br>
            Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet<br>
            I'ma get mine and get going<br>
            I'm showing my faces in just enough places<br>
            I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room<br>
            My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof<br>
            Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset<br>
            Will help us get ours as we're growing<br>
            This clique means so much to this dude<br>
            It could make him afraid of his music<br>
            And be scared to death he could lose it<br>
            <br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            <br>    
            I'll sit here 'til I<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            <br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>
            I'll sit here 'til I find the problem<br>
            No, I move slow<br>
            I want to stop time<br>

            I can feel pressure start to possess my mind<br>
            So I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise<br>
