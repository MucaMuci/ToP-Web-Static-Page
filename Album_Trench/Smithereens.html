        <p>
            You know<br>
            I've always been collected, calm and chill<br>
            And you know<br>
            I never look for conflict for the thrill<br>
            But if I’m feeling<br>
            Someone stepping towards you, can't describe<br>
            Just what I'm feeling<br>
            <br>
            For you, I’d go<br>
            Step to a dude much bigger than me<br>
            For you, I know<br>
            I would get messed up, weigh 153<br>
            For you<br>
            I would get beat to smithereens<br>
            <br>
            You know<br>
            I'll be in the corner taking notes<br>
            And you know<br>
            I got your six while you're working votes<br>
            But if I'm feeling<br>
            Someone stepping towards you, can't describe<br>
            Just what I'm feeling<br>
            <br>
            For you, I'd go<br>
            Step to a dude much bigger than me<br>
            For you, I know<br>
            I would get messed up, weigh 153<br>
            For you<br>
            I would get beat to smithereens<br>
            <br>
            (Fight fight fight fight fight)<br>
            (I would get beat to)<br>
            You know I had to do one<br>
            You know I had to do one<br>
            You know I had to do one on the record (For you)<br>
            You know I had to do one on the record for her like this<br>
            You know I had to do one on the record for her like this<br>
            You know I had to do one on the record for her like this<br>
            You know I had to do one on the record for her<br>
            <br>
            If I'm feeling<br>
            Someone stepping towards you, can’t describe<br>
            Just what I’m feeling<br>
            <br>
            For you, I'd go<br>
            Write a slick song just to show you the world<br>
            For you, I know<br>
            They think it’s messed up to sell out for your girl<br>
            For you, I'd go<br>
            Step to a dude much bigger than me<br>
            For you, I know<br>
            I would get messed up, weigh 153<br>
