            I'm tired of tending to this fire<br>
            I've used up all I've collected<br>
            I have singed my hands<br>
            It's glowing, embers barely showing<br>
            Proof of life in the shadows<br>
            Dancing on my plans<br>
            <br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            <br>
            The burning is so low it's concerning<br>
            'Cause they know that when it goes out<br>
            It's a glorious gone<br>
            It's only time before they show me<br>
            Why no one ever comes back<br>
            With details from beyond<br>
            <br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            (They know)<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            (They know)<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            (They know)<br>
            (They know)<br>
            (They know)<br>
            (They know)<br>
            <br>
            In time, I will leave the city<br>
            For now, I will stay alive<br>
            In time, I will leave the city<br>
            For now, I will stay alive<br>
            In time, I will leave the city<br>
            For now, I will stay alive<br>
            In time, I will leave the city<br>
            For now, I will stay alive<br>
            <br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>
            They know that it's almost<br>
            They know that it's almost over<br>

            Last year I needed change of pace<br>
            Couldn't take the pace of change<br>
            Moving hastily<br>
            But this year, though I'm far from home<br>
            In Trench I'm not alone<br>
            These faces facin' me<br>
            <br>
            They know<br>
            They know<br>
            What I mean<br>
