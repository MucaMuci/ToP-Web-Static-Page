            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            <br>
            This is the sound we make<br>
            When in between two places<br>
            Where we used to bleed<br>
            And where our blood needs to be<br>
            <br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            <br>
            In City, I feel my spirit is contained<br>
            Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain<br>
            But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire<br>
            Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire<br>
            Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof<br>
            But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth<br>
            Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you<br>
            The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through<br>
            <br>
            Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>
            Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>
            I created this world to feel some control<br>
            Destroy it if I want<br>
            So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo<br>
            <br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito (Sahlo)<br>
            I could take the high road<br>
            But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)<br>
            I'm a ban—I'm a bandito<br>
            <br>
            I created this world to feel some control<br>
            Destroy it if I want<br>
            So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina<br>
