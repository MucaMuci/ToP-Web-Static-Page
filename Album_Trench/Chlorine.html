            So, where are ya? It's been a little while<br>
            <br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            Let the vibe slide over me<br>
            This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
            When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
            I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
            The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            <br>
            Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah<br>
            Venom on my tongue, dependent at times<br>
            Poisonous vibrations, woah<br>
            Help my body run<br>
            <br>
            I'm runnin' for my life<br>
            Runnin' for my life<br>
            <br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            Let the vibe slide over me<br>
            This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
            When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
            I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
            The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            <br>
            Fall out of formation, woah<br>
            I plan my escape from walls they confined<br>
            Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh<br>
            Grows while I decay<br>
            <br>
            I'm runnin' for my life<br>
            Runnin' for my life<br>
            Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life<br>
            Runnin' for my life<br>
            <br>
            Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
            I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
            Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
            The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
            The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
            But now you double as a paper maker<br>
            I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight<br>   
            And you in my life is like<br>
            <br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            Let the vibe slide over me<br>
            This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
            When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
            I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
            The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
            <br>
            Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
            Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
            Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
            Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
            Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
            Moment is medical, yeah<br>
            Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

            Let me catch you up to speed<br>
            I've been tested like the ends of<br>
            A weathered flag that's by the sea<br>
            Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
            I'm just a chemical<br>
