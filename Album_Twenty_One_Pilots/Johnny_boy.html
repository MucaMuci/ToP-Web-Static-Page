            He stays home from work this time<br>
            He never really told his wife<br>
            He never really told a lie<br>
            But this time he decides that it's alright<br>
            It's alright<br>
            <br>
            No one really knows his mind<br>
            And no one knows behind his eyes<br>
            The man deserves a medal<br>
            But he's never really won a prize<br>
            Before<br>
            He goes to lock the door<br>
            <br>
            He has fallen in love<br>
            He knows it's enough<br>
            But the world looks down and frowns<br>
            <br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy<br>
            Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now<br>
            <br>
            We all need you now<br>
            <br>
            Someone said, "Away you go"<br>
            And someone said to you, "Goodbye"<br>
            They deflect<br>
            The disrespect<br>
            When they say that they blame it on the times<br>
            They blame it on the time<br>
            <br>
            We all know you're qualified<br>
            To fix a chair and love your wife<br>
            They all know you're qualified<br>
            But they lie when they blame it on the times<br>
            Oh, we blame it on the times<br>
            <br>
            He has fallen in love<br>
            He knows it's enough<br>
            But the world looks down and frowns<br>
            <br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy<br>
            Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now<br>
            <br>
            We all need you now<br>
            <br>
            I will carry all your names<br>
            And I will carry all your shame<br>
            And I will carry all your names<br>
            And I will carry all your shame<br>
            And I will carry all your names<br>
            And I will carry all your shame<br>
            <br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy<br>
            Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground<br>

            Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            You're my pride and joy<br>
            Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now<br>
