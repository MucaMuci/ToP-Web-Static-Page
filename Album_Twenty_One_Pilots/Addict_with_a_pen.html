            Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time<br>
            I know I haven't been the best of sons<br>
            Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind<br>
            And I haven't found a drop of life<br>
            I haven't found a drop of you<br>
            I haven't found a drop<br>
            I haven't found a drop of water<br>
            Water, oh, oh<br>
            <br>
            I try desperately to run through the sand<br>
            As I hold the water in the palm of my hand<br>
            'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need<br>
            And the waves of the water mean nothing to me<br>
            But I try my best and all that I can to<br>
            Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand<br>
            But no matter how, how tightly I will strain<br>
            The sand will slow me down and the water will drain<br>
            I'm just being dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again<br>
            As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind<br>
            As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend<br>
            Of course I'll be here again, see you tomorrow, but it's the end of today<br>
            End of my ways as a walking denial<br>
            My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case<br>
            But you specialize in dying, you hear me screaming, "Father!"<br>
            And I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water<br>
            Oh, oh, water<br>
            <br>

            Water, oh, oh<br>
