            He wakes up early today<br>
            Throws on a mask that will alter his face<br>
            Nobody knows his real name<br>
            But now he just uses one he saw on a grave<br>
            <br>
            And he pretends he's okay, but you should see, oh<br>
            Him in bed late at night, he's petrified<br>
            <br>
            Take me out, and finish this waste of a life<br>
            Everyone gather around for a show<br>
            Watch as this man disappears as we know<br>
            Do me a favor and try to ignore<br>
            As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor<br>
            <br>
            He thinks that faith might be dead<br>
            Nothing kills a man faster than his own head<br>
            He used to see dreams at night<br>
            But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes<br>
            <br>
            And he pretends he's okay, but you should see<br>
            Him in bed late at night, he's petrified<br>
            <br>
            Take me out and finish this waste of a life<br>
            Everyone gather around for a show<br>
            Watch as this man disappears as we know<br>
            Do me a favor and try to ignore<br>
            As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor<br>
            Yeah, yeah<br>
            Yeah, yeah!<br>
            <br>
            Oh, yeah<br>
            Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Take me out and finish this waste of a life<br>
            Everyone gather around for a show<br>
            Watch as this man disappears as we know<br>
            Do me a favor and try to ignore<br>
            When you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor<br>
            <br>
            'Cause nobody knows his life<br>
