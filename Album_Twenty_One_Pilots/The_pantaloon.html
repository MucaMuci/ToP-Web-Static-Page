        <p>
            Three, four<br>
            Your grandpa died<br>
            When you were nine<br>
            They said he had lost his mind<br>
            You have learned<br>
            Way too soon<br>
            You should never trust the Pantaloon<br>
            <br>
            Now it's your turn<br>
            To be alone<br>
            Find a wife and build yourself a home<br>
            You have learned<br>
            Way too soon<br>
            That your dad is now the Pantaloon<br>
            <br>
            You are tired<br>
            You are hurt<br>
            A moth ate through<br>
            Your favorite shirt<br>
            And all your friends<br>
            Fertilize<br>
            The ground you walk<br>
            Lose your mind<br>
            <br>
            He's seen too many stare downs<br>
            Between the sun and the moon<br>
            In the morning air<br>
            How he used to hustle all the people<br>
            Walking through the fairgrounds<br>
            He's been around so long<br>
            He's changed his meaning of a chair now<br>
            Because a chair now,<br>
            Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people<br>
            Who glide across the very surface<br>
            That made his bones feeble<br>
            The end can't come soon enough<br>
            But is it too soon?<br>
            Either way he can't deny<br>
            He is a Pantaloon<br>
            <br>
            You are tired<br>
            You are hurt<br>
            A moth ate through<br>
            Your favorite shirt<br>
            And all your friends<br>
            Fertilize<br>
            The ground you walk<br>
            Lose your mind<br>
            <br>
            You like to sleep alone<br>
            It's colder than you know<br>
            'Cause your skin is so used to colder bones<br>
            It's warmer in the morning<br>
            Than what it is at night<br>
            Your bones are held together<br>
            By your nightmares and your frights<br>
            <br>
            You are tired<br>
            You are hurt<br>
            A moth ate through<br>
            Your favorite shirt<br>
            And all your friends<br>
            They fertilize<br>
            The ground you walk<br>
            So lose your mind<br>
            <br>
            You are tired<br>
            You are hurt<br>
            A moth ate through<br>
            Your favorite shirt<br>
            And all your friends<br>
            They fertilize<br>
            The ground you walk<br>
            Lose your mind<br>
