        <p>
            The air begins to feel a little thin<br>
            As I start the car and then I begin<br>
            To add the miles piled up behind me<br>
            I barely feel a smile deep inside me<br>
            <br>
            And I begin to envy the headlights driving south<br>
            I want to crack the door so I can just fall out<br>
            But then I remember when you packed my car<br>
            You reached in the back and buckled up your heart<br>
            <br>
            For me to drive away with<br>
            I began to understand why God died<br>
            <br>
            The demon sat there waiting on her porch<br>
            It was a little dark, so he held a makeshift torch<br>
            And when my car was far out of sight<br>
            He crept in her room and stayed there for the night<br>
            <br>
            And then I felt chills in my bones<br>
            The breath I saw was not my own<br>
            I knew my skin that wrapped my frame<br>
            Wasn't made to play this game<br>
            And then I saw him, torch in hand<br>
            He laid it out, what he had planned<br>
            And then I said, "I'll take the grave<br>
            Please, just send them all my way"<br>
            Then I felt chills in my bones<br>
            The breath I saw was not my own<br>
            I knew my skin that wrapped my frame<br>
            Wasn't made to play this game<br>
            And then I saw him, torch in hand<br>
            He laid it out, what he had planned<br>
            And then I said, "I'll take the grave<br>
            Please, just send them all my way"<br>
            <br>
            I began to understand why God died<br>
            <br>
            The air begins to feel a little thin<br>
            As we're waiting for the morning to begin<br>
            But for now, you told me to hold this jar<br>
            And when I looked inside, I saw it held your heart<br>
            <br>
            For me to walk away with<br>
            I began to understand why God died<br>
