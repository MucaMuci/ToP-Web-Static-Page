            Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty sleeper<br>
            Your twisted mind is like snow on the road<br>
            Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder<br>
            Inside your head than the winter of dead<br>
            <br>
            I will tell you I love you<br>
            But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears<br>
            My nose and feet are running as we start<br>
            To travel through snow<br>
            Together we go<br>
            Together we go<br>
            <br>
            We get colder<br>
            As we grow older<br>
            We will walk<br>
            So much slower<br>
            <br>
            Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty weeper<br>
            Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops<br>
            Please, take my hand, we're in foreign land<br>
            As we travel through snow<br>
            Together we go<br>
            Together we go<br>
            <br>
            We get colder<br>
            As we grow older<br>
            We will walk<br>
            So much slower<br>
