            La da da da<br>
            La da da da da da da<br>

            Now is the climax to the story<br>
            That gives the demons and angels purpose<br>
            They fly around while we are walking<br>
            And mold our emotions just to please them<br>
            <br>
            I am cold, can you hear?<br>
            I will fly with no hope, no fear<br>
            And the ground taunts my wings<br>
            Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing<br>
            <br>
            All we are is an isle of flightless birds<br>
            We find our worth in giving birth and stuff<br>
            We're lining our homes against winding roads<br>
            And we think the going is tough<br>
            We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that nobody cares about<br>
            And honestly, we're probably more suicidal than ever now<br>
            If you decide to live by what you think's wrong and what's right<br>
            Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping<br>
            Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry<br>
            But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe<br>
            We can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free<br>
            <br>
            I am cold, can you hear?<br>
            I will fly with no hope, no fear<br>
            And the ground taunts my wings<br>
            Plummet as I sing, plummet as I<br>
            I am cold, can you hear?<br>
            I will fly with no hope, no fear<br>
            And the ground taunts my wings<br>
            Plummet as I sing, plummet as I<br>
            <br>
            How frustrating and so degrading<br>
            His time, we're wasting as time will fly by<br>
            And the sky will cry as light is fading<br>
            And He is waiting, oh, so patiently<br>
            While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability<br>
            And please don't think about why you can't sleep in the evening<br>
            And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking<br>
            Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides<br>
            And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you, this is mine<br>
            I promise you, this is mine<br>
